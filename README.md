# Q2DTor
Q2DTor is a program designed to calculate partition functions and thermodynamic properties of molecular systems with two or more torsional modes. It allows one to calculate rotational-vibrational (or rovibrational) partition functions and thermodynamic functions by the multistructural harmonic oscillator (MS-HO) and the Extended Two-Dimensional Torsion (E2DT) methods.
