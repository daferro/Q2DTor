 About Q2DTor
--------------

    Name of the Program: Q2DTor
 
    Program Version : 1.0
 
    Program Version Date: March 19, 2018 
 
    Manual Version Date: May 22, 2018 

Q2DTor is a program designed to calculate partition functions and thermodynamic 
properties of molecular systems with two or more torsional modes. 
It allows one to calculate rotational-vibrational (or rovibrational) 
partition functions and thermodynamic functions by the multistructural harmonic 
oscillator (MS-HO) and the Extended Two-Dimensional Torsion (E2DT) methods. 
If the molecule has more than two torsions, the program treats only two of them as 
torsions, with the others harmonic. 
Q2DTor has to be executed in several steps, each one of them performing a different task. 
With this 'step-by-step' procedure the user can check the output file after a 
given task (and before proceeding to the next one).

 Description of files
----------------------

 Contents of the folders distributed in this version:
  - source     : Q2DTor source files
  - documents  : Manual of Q2DTor
  - tests      : All the files related to the tests set

The Q2DTor source folder consists of the following files:

   * mesc.txt:
     It contains the path to the executables to the Electronic Structure Calculation software.
     THIS IS THE ONLY FILE THAT HAS TO BE MODIFIED BY THE USER.

   * Q2DTor.py:
     This is the main file of Q2DTor, i.e., the one to be executed

   * constants.py:
      It contains different physical constants as well as atomic masses and covalent radii.

   * classes.py:
     It contains different Python classes that are used along the whole code. 
     For example, it contains different classes related to graph theory. 
     These allow to obtain the connectivity of a given geometry or a set of 
     internal coordinates in just a few calls.

   * gtsfile.py:
     It contains functions that read and write a gts file (the format used by Q2Dtor). 
     These gts files contain information about stationary points: geometry, gradient, 
     Hessian matrix, etc.

   * helpfns.py:
     It contains different auxiliary functions (for example the function
     that converts Cartesian coordinates to mass-scaled Cartesian).

   * mesc_gaussian.py:
     It contains the interface to the Gaussian Package.

   * mesc_orca.py:
     It contains the interface to the Orca Package.

   * tesselation.py:
     It contains functions related to the tesselation of the 2D potential energy surface.

   * quotes.py:
     It contains some quotes to print when the program ends.

The tests folder contains the output files of the tests set and an script to run them. 
The documents folder contains this manual.

--------------
 Installation
--------------

Q2Dtor is a program written in Python 2. Consequently, it does not need any kind 
of compilation, as it would be the case with C or Fortran programs.
The user should install Python 2 in order to use Q2DTor (version 2.7 is recommended), 
as well as the following Python libraries:
   - matplotlib
   - numpy
   - pylab
   - scipy

WARNING: do not use Python 3 to execute Q2DTor.

----------------------
 Installation with PIP
----------------------

Q2DTor can be installed using pip if preferred. Just execute:

    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ q2dtor

This will install Q2DTor as a packege of Python, and the executable script (Q2DTor.py) will be placed at bin/. The other files, including the mesc.txt file, will be placed at:

    lib/python2.7/site_packages/q2dtor.


-----------------------
 Setting up the program
-----------------------

Before using Q2DTor, the user have to define the path to the executable(s) of the software for the electronic structure calculation.
This is done in file 'mesc.txt'.

For Gaussian users, this file has to contain these lines:

    mesc_gaussian  gauexe  "PATH_TO_GAUSSIANEXE"
    mesc_gaussian  fchk    "PATH_TO_FCHK"
   
where PATH_TO_GAUSSIANEXE and PATH_TO_FCHK are the paths to the Gaussian and formchk 
executables.
Example:

    mesc_gaussian  gauexe  "/home/programs/G09_64D/g09/g09"
    mesc_gaussian  fchk    "/home/programs/G09_64D/g09/formchk"
   
Notice that the path is between quotation marks(").

Similarly, for Orca users, this file has to contain the line:

    mesc_orca      orca  "PATH_TO_ORCAEXE"
    
where, again, the path to the Orca executable is between quotation marks. 
Example:

    mesc_orca      orca  "/home/programs/orca_4_0_1_2/orca"

-----------
 Execution
-----------

You can run Q2DTor by invoking the Python interpreter manually as follows:

     $ python2.7 Q2DTor.py

If you prefer to avoid invoking the Python interpreter, you have to follow these
two simple steps:

(1) Add as first line in the Q2DTor.py the following:

      #!PATH_FOR_PYTHON python 

   where PATH_FOR_PYTHON indicates the location of the Python interpreter.
   Example:
   
      #!/usr/bin/env python

   In this example Python is located in /usr/bin/env. 

(2) Make the main program Q2DTor.py executable:

      $ chmod u+x Q2DTor.py
      
   which allows you to run Q2DTor just with:
   
      $ Q2DTor.py

Before starting using Q2DTor, we recommend to read the help menu, which can be 
displayed either by typing

    $ Q2DTor.py --help
   
or 

    $ Q2DTor.py -h

---------------------
Running the tests set
---------------------

In the tests directory there is a script called Q2DTor_tests.py 
that facilitates running the tests set. 
                                                            
The script runs under Python version 2.x. It is executed by typing:

    >> python Q2DTor_tests.py                                 

This action opens the next interactive menu:                  

     | << Test creator for Q2DTor >>                        
     |                                                      
     |    (1) Create input files                            
     |    (2) Check results                                 
     |                                                      
     |    your choice:                                      
     |                                                      
where you should choose option 1. 

At this point, the script generates two folders:                                      
    * GAUSSIAN                                              
    * ORCA                                                  
and each of them contains 20 test folders (one per system). 
                                                            
For each system, you can find the xyz file with the         
reference geometry and the corresponding Q2DTor input file. 
                                                            
After executing Q2DTor.py for a given system (or for all of    
them), you can check your results by using the option 2     
of the Q2DTor_tests.py script. This checking process can    
be performed after every single step of Q2DTor or after     
executing it with all the options.                          
                                                            
IMPORTANT NOTICE: The searching algorithm for systems  
S10 and S19 is not able to find one transition state, and     
Q2DTor_tests.py complains if you execute it once      
Q2DTor ends the tasks associated to the --optsp argument.   
In these cases, the user should add the following line  
at the end of the SXX/IOfiles/SXX.splist file (XX=10,19). 

For XX=10:

    1 170.00 60.00 - NO S10_170_060
   
For XX=19:

    1 130.00 70.00 - NO S19_130_070

Check the manual for more information about the search and
optimization procedures of the stationary points.
